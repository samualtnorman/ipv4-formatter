# IPv4 Formatter
This is a demo using the [`internet-address`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/internet-address) NPM package and is hosted at https://samualtnorman.github.io/ipv4-formatter/.

[View documentation for `internet-address`.](https://samualtnorman.github.io/internet-address/)

Below are the instructions on how to use [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/) which was used to build this demo.

---

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://solid-cli.netlify.app)
